Ruby Tanbo: An implementation of the Mark Steere game Tanbo, using Ruby and
wxRuby for the GUI.

For more information on Tanbo, and the original rule set, see:
http://www.marksteeregames.com/

USAGE:
  To run the program first install wxruby ('sudo gem install wxruby').
  Then do 'ruby app.rb' or simply './app.rb'

THANKS:
  Special thanks to Pierre Gueth and Joel Schaerer and their C++ UCT
  implementation: <http://github.com/joelthelion/uct>
  
  And of course, thanks to Mark Steere for the game and his explicit
  permission for anyone to code it!

CHANGES:

1.0  (2009-09-22) - The game is finished! Fixed Ulysses bug, and optimized
    code for 3x Ulysses performance improvement. Next stop, net play via GGZ!

0.9b (2009-09-21) - 
    Major release! You can now play the game against Ulysses,
    an AI that implements UCT (Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees). This
    is the state of the art AI system for Go games.

    Unfortunately, it's slow as crap at the moment. I'm going to try to trade
    some space for speed before releasing 1.0b

0.5b (2009-09-21) - Game is playable against Ranbo, the Random Tanbo AI!

0.2b (2009-09-20) - Major refactoring, saving games works now!

0.1.1b (2009-09-19) - Turn off auto-playing by default. To toggle
    auto-playing, use the debug button.

0.1b   (2009-09-18)- Initial 'release'. A working game, playable by two people
    'hot seat' style. Saving games works, but loading them doesn't. There is
    no AI yet.
