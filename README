CHANGES:
0.2b (2009-09-20) - Major refactoring, saving games works now!

0.1.1b (2009-09-19) - Turn off auto-playing by default. To toggle
    auto-playing, use the debug button.

0.1b   (2009-09-18)- Initial 'release'. A working game, playable by two people
    'hot seat' style. Saving games works, but loading them doesn't. There is
    no AI yet.
